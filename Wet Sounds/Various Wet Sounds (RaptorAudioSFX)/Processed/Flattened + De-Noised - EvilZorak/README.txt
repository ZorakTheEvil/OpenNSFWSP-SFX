These files have been spectrally 'flattened' and then EQ'd and then spectrally de-noised (spectral downwards expansion) and then EQ'd again.

The files can be useful processed alternatives for something a bit less intrusive (i.e. less high frequencies with more uniform energy in mid-to-high frequencies result in it poking out a lot less in a mix once proper gain staging is performed).
